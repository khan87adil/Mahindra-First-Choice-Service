# Mahindra-First-Choice-Service-Capstone-Project
Mahindra First Choice Services (MFCS) is a company of Mahindra Group and is Indiaâ€™s leading
chain of multi-brand car workshops with over 335+ workshops present in 267+ towns & 24
states. It has serviced over 10,50,000 cars. The company aims to establish countrywide network
of over 400 workshops by March 2018.

Geolocation Based Customer Analysis:
The idea is to explore how various factors like car make & model, time and type of service etc.
vary with location. Since the servicing industry is local in nature, this kind of an analysis could
possibly render some really interesting business insights.
